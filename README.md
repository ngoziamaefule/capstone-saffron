Saffron Description

Saffron is an iOS app that assists with the widely-understood struggle that most adults face -- figuring out what they are going to make for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner! 

Feature Set

Random Recipe Generator:
Saffron includes a random recipe generator that the user can interact with to save to their virtual cookbook. Similar to Tinder, the user can decide to try a recipe by swiping right on the image presented to them or dismiss a potential meal by swiping left. 

Cookbook:
Once the user swipes right, the recipe is automatically added to that user's cookbook where the details of the recipe are made available.

Dependencies

Spoonacular
Swift
SwiftUI
